C.S. Lewis in *Surprised by Joy*
gives the following definition of the term Joy:
"An unsatisfied desire which is itself
more desirable than any other satisfaction."
It is not pleasure, but instead a kind of desirable longing.
It is a feeling that I know well, praise the Lord,
and I have decided to record all the places that I see or feel it.

I've noticed patterns in the sort of things that inspire Joy in me,
and have come up with the following categories:
* Holy Man -- someone who spreads goodness wherever they go
* King -- the good man gone to war, and justice will be done
* Renewal -- the promise of redemption and a bright new future
* Exile -- the sense that we are displaced from our true home
* Body -- the unity of humanity
* Call -- the first awareness of Joy

# Television
* In *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, in Uncle Iroh.
  In his patience and loving grace for Zuko,
  in his strength and commitment to defending what is good,
  in the way that anyone who meets him is better for the meeting.
  Also in Zuko, in his redemption.
  (Holy Man, Renewal)

* In "Mercury and Lightning" by John Mark McMillan.
  "I swear I've heard the echoes of a voice /
  Like a dream that you feel but you don't remember /
  I've known it ever since I was a boy /
  Like a word on the tip of my tongue."
  (Call)
* In "The Valley" (especially the reprise) by The Oh Hellos in
  *Through the Deep Dark Valley*.

  (Call)
* In "Soldier, Poet, King" by The Oh Hellos in *Dear Wormwood*.
  "There will come a ruler whose brow is laid in thorn /
  Smeared with oil like David's boy /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord /
  He will tear your city down /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord."
  (King)
* In "Lift Together" from the game *Warframe*.
  "Cold, the air and water flowing. /
  Hard, the land we call our home. /
  Push, to keep the dark from coming. /
  Feel the weight of what we owe."
  "And we all lift, and we're all adrift /
  Together / Together."
  (Exile, Body)

# Musical Theatre
* In "When I Grow Up" from *Matilda*.

  waiting to be explored, discovered, and enjoyed.
