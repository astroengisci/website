C.S. Lewis in *Surprised by Joy*
gives the following definition of the term Joy:
"An unsatisfied desire which is itself
more desirable than any other satisfaction."
It is not pleasure, but instead a kind of desirable longing.
It is a feeling that I know well, praise the Lord,
and I have decided to record all the places that I see or feel it.

# Television
* In *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, in Uncle Iroh.
  In his patience and loving grace for Zuko,
  in his strength and commitment to defending what is good,
  in the way that anyone who meets him is better for the meeting.
  Also in Zuko, in his redemption.
* In *Doctor Who*, in [Rory Williams, The Last Centurion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRDB0evx58k).

# Literature
* In *The Lord of the Rings*, constantly.
* In Narnia's *The Last Battle*,
  when we learn that all of the stories have only been "the cover and title page"
  in an endless, ever-improving story.
* In *The Wingfeather Saga*, constantly.

# Music
* In "See You Again", by The Gray Havens in *She Waits*.
  "I always knew you could be like this / I saw flashes and glimpses before."
* In "Mercury and Lightning" by John Mark McMillan.
  "I swear I've heard the echoes of a voice /
  Like a dream that you feel but you don't remember /
  I've known it ever since I was a boy /
  Like a word on the tip of my tongue."
* In "The Valley" (especially the reprise) by The Oh Hellos in
  *Through the Deep Dark Valley*.
  "We were born in the valley of the dead and the wicked /
  Where our father's father fell to the crimes he committed /
  We were young when we heard you call our names in the silence."
* In "Soldier, Poet, King" by The Oh Hellos in *Dear Wormwood*.
  "There will come a ruler whose brow is laid in thorn /
  Smeared with oil like David's boy /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord /
  He will tear your city down /
  O lei, O lai, O Lord."
* In "Lift Together" from the game *Warframe*.
  "Cold, the air and water flowing. /
  Hard, the land we call our home. /
  Push, to keep the dark from coming. /
  Feel the weight of what we owe."
  "And we all lift, and we're all adrift /
  Together / Together."

# Musical Theatre
* In "When I Grow Up" from *Matilda*.
  "When I grow up /
  I will be tall enough to reach the branches /
  That I have to reach to climb the trees you get to climb when you're grown up."
* In "Stay I Pray You" from *Anastasia*.
  "Hard and sweet and bitter to leave it all /
  I'll bless my homeland 'til I die."

# Elsewhere
* In the opening of *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*,
  when you step out of the cave and behold a massive, beautiful world,
  waiting to be explored, discovered, and enjoyed.
