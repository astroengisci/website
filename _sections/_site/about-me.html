<p>I’m a junior composition major at Oklahoma Baptist University.
I write music for music’s sake, but I’m primarily interested in scoring narrative works
such as film, video games, tabletop RPG campaigns, and theatre productions.
Past and current projects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal DnD campaign, titled <em>Thanes of the Nameless Spark</em></li>
</ul>
