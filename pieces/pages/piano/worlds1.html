<p>It's always hurricane season on Shgalan!
Welcome to a world of constant winds and frequent stormsâ€”my favorite weather!</p>
<p>Worlds I: Shgalan is a part of my ongoing Worlds series.
Worlds explores music's ability to set a scene and tell a story.
Each piece in the series is accompanied by a short bit of prose
which describes the scene suggested to me by the music.</p>
<blockquote><p>Immediately, a gust of wind threatens to tackle you to the ground.
You quickly grab hold of a tree trunk,
barely keeping yourself on your feet.
All around you, overgrown jungle. Everything seems to be leaning;
all the trees, plants, and even the ground itself have been
indelibly bent by the unrelenting gale.</p>
<p>Something like a kite slowly raises itself into the air.
It's an insect-like creature with broad, flat wings.
Little by little, it lets out a strand of silk,
tethering it to a nearby tree.
The creature glides deftly around flying debris,
controlling itself by adjusting its angle against the current.
It spots something and snatches it out of the air.
It's a small berry.
The kite-creature dives quickly onto a tree,
nestles safely in the lee of the storm,
and devours its prize.
Then it leaps back into the current,
ready to do it all over again.</p>
<p>An earsplitting crack of thunder rolls across the sky.
The wind fills with water; it's raining now.
The insect quickly gets to shelter.
As the water creeps up to your ankles,
you think you'd better do the same.</p>
</blockquote>
