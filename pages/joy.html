<p>C.S. Lewis in <em>Surprised by Joy</em>
gives the following definition of the term Joy:
"An unsatisfied desire which is itself
more desirable than any other satisfaction."
It is not pleasure, but instead a kind of desirable longing.
It is a feeling that I know well, praise the Lord,
and I have decided to record all the places that I see or feel it.</p>
<p>I've noticed patterns in the sort of things that inspire Joy in me,
and have come up with the following categories:
<ul>
<li>Holy Man -- someone who spreads goodness wherever they go</li>
<li>King -- the good man gone to war, and justice will be done</li>
<li>Renewal -- the promise of redemption and a bright new future</li>
<li>Exile -- the sense that we are displaced from our true home</li>
<li>Body -- the unity of humanity</li>
<li>Call -- the first awareness of Joy</li>
</ul>
