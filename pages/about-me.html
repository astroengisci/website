<p>I'm a senior composition major at Oklahoma Baptist University.
While I do write pure music for its own sake, my primary interest is scoring narrative works
such as film, video games, tabletop RPG campaigns, and theatre productions.
Past and current projects include:
<ul>
<li>Personal DnD campaign, titled <em>Thanes of the Nameless Spark</em> (Ongoing)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatricks.org/">Theatricks</a> production of <em>House at Pooh Corner</em> (Summer 2019)</li>
<li><em>Worlds</em>, a series of solo piano pieces exploring music's ability to excite
the visual and narrative imagination.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>My stylistic influences include:
<ul>
<li>Film composers such as John Powell, John Williams, and Danny Elfman</li>
<li>Folk music in the Celtic and American traditions</li>
<li>Modern jazz artists such as Adam Neely and Snarky Puppy</li>
<li>Video game composers such as Koji Kondo, Toby Fox, and Christopher Larkin</li>
</ul>

<p>As a performer, I sing tenor in the Bison Glee Club,
was the bassist for the Bison Jazz Orchestra,
and am the bassist for Symphonic Winds.
I have also performed several roles with Theatricks community theatre in Sherman, TX,
including Chef Louis in <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and Tom Thumb in <em>Peter Rabbit</em>.
I also played bass for <em>A Year With Frog and Toad</em> with Theatricks.</p>
