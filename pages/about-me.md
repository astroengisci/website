I'm a senior composition major at Oklahoma Baptist University.
While I do write pure music for its own sake, my primary interest is scoring narrative works
such as film, video games, tabletop RPG campaigns, and theatre productions.
Past and current projects include:
- Personal DnD campaign, titled *Thanes of the Nameless Spark* (Ongoing)
- [Theatricks](https://www.theatricks.org/) production of *House at Pooh Corner* (Summer 2019)
- *Worlds*, a series of solo piano pieces exploring music's ability to excite
  the visual and narrative imagination.

My stylistic influences include:
- Film composers such as John Powell, John Williams, and Danny Elfman
- Folk music in the Celtic and American traditions
- Modern jazz artists such as Adam Neely and Snarky Puppy
- Video game composers such as Koji Kondo, Toby Fox, and Christopher Larkin

As a performer, I sing tenor in the Bison Glee Club,
was the bassist for the Bison Jazz Orchestra,
and am the bassist for Symphonic Winds.
I have also performed several roles with Theatricks community theatre in Sherman, TX,
including Chef Louis in *The Little Mermaid*, and Tom Thumb in *Peter Rabbit*.
I also played bass for *A Year With Frog and Toad* with Theatricks.
